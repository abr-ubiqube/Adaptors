Manufacturer and Model ID Convention
====================================


If you need to create a new manufacturer or new model ID,
you must follow the following convention:

YYMMDDNN:

-YY last 2 digits of the year : e.g. 16 for 2016

-MM months e.g. 05 for May

-DD day of the month

-NN number in case you need to develop more than one adaptor on the same day.

This is to make sure that there is no conflict with existing adapters.

If you need to add a new adapter with an existing manufacturer but a new model, make sur that you use the same ID and name as used by the existing adapter.

There are many similar examples with Cisco or Fortinet manufacturer and various models.
