# MSA-Device-Adaptors

The MSActivator(TM) is a multi-tenant, full lifecycle management framework developed for agile service
design and assurance, making automation not only possible - but easy.

### Device Adaptors

The MSActivator comes with several pre-built device adaptors providing all the necessary functionality lifecycle management from provisioning to image and asset management. Adaptors provide the necessary interface to communicate with different devices.
